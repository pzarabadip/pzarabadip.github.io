I am eager in benefiting from the synergy between my computational skills and experimental background to tackle challenging energy and
environmental obstacles at the intersection of material and computational science. I have developed the experimental skills throughout
my MSc and PhD studies while I have learned computational techniques after my PhD on my own interest and effort. Although I am able to
conduct independent research projects, I thrive working as a team member and have proactively collaborated with researchers at different
institutions around the world to complete various projects.


I am currently working in [University of Bath](www.bath.ac.uk) as research associated in the research groups of [Prof. Saiful Islam](https://people.bath.ac.uk/msi20/index.shtml) and [Dr. Benjamin Morgan](https://morgan-group-bath.github.io/). We are performing research on Li-ion batteries within the [CATMAT project](https://catmatproject.com/) which is funded by [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/) on "Next Generation Lithium Ion Cathode Materials".
