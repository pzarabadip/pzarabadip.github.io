I am eager in benefiting from the synergy between my computational skills and experimental background to tackle challenging energy and
environmental obstacles at the intersection of material and computational science. I have developed the experimental skills throughout
my MSc and PhD studies while I have learned computational techniques after my PhD on my own interest and effort. Although I am able to
conduct independent research projects, I thrive working as a team member and have proactively collaborated with researchers at different
institutions around the world to complete various projects.


I am currently working in [University of Bath](www.bath.ac.uk) as research associated in the research groups of [Prof. Saiful Islam](https://people.bath.ac.uk/msi20/index.shtml) and [Dr. Benjamin Morgan](https://morgan-group-bath.github.io/). We are performing research on Li-ion batteries within the [CATMAT project](https://catmatproject.com/) which is funded by [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/) on "Next Generation Lithium Ion Cathode Materials".

## A rough timeline

Below is a (somewhat experimental) rough timeline of what I've been up to over the past several years.

2020: **Co-Founded [2i2c](https://2i2c.org)**
^^^

2i2c is a non-profit organization that makes interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community. It supports the delpoyment of open infrastructure for this community, and also supports the open source communities underneath this infrastructure.

**2017** Joined the Jupyter Project
^^^

After finishing graduate school I began a Post-Doc with [Fernando Perez](http://fperez.org/), focusing my work around applying and developing the Jupyter ecosystem to support workflows in research and education. Here are a few of the main things I did during this time:

- Co-lead the [Binder Project](https://mybinder.org) for interactive, reproducible, sharable computational environments.
- Co-lead the [JupyterHub team](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html), which builds tools for deploying interactive computing environments on shared infrastructure.
- Served as "community architect" for the [Berkeley Data Science Education Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep), which runs JupyterHubs on campus for education.
- Co-launched the [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org), a tool for building books from collections of notebooks and markdown files.

**2011** Graduate school at Berkeley
^^^

My scientific training began as a neuroscientist, where I studied the ways that humans process speech and sound. I used computational models and machine learning to tie patterns of brain activity to spectral features of sound. In particular I focused on **speech in noise** to understand how our brain fills in missing details in auditory information.
